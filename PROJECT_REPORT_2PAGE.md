# E-commerce Application on Kubernetes - Project Report

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the deployment of a modern e-commerce application on Kubernetes with comprehensive monitoring, auto-scaling, and production-ready configurations. The application includes a Next.js frontend, MongoDB database, and a complete observability stack with Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and alerting.

## Abstract

The project successfully implements a containerized e-commerce platform using Kubernetes orchestration, featuring:
- **Microservices Architecture**: Separated frontend, database, and monitoring services
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Real-time metrics collection with Prometheus and Grafana dashboards
- **Auto-scaling**: Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for dynamic resource management
- **Production-Ready**: Health checks, resource limits, and persistent storage
- **External Access**: NodePort services for public accessibility

The solution addresses common deployment challenges including port conflicts, metrics collection, and service discovery while providing enterprise-grade monitoring and alerting capabilities.

- **Grafana Dashboards**: Created production-ready dashboards with 8+ panels
- **MongoDB Exporter**: Integrated database metrics collection
- **Alerting Rules**: Configured alerts for critical system metrics
- **Metrics Server**: Enabled HPA functionality with resource metrics

### 6. Auto-scaling Configuration
- **HPA Setup**: Configured horizontal scaling based on CPU utilization
- **Resource Limits**: Defined appropriate CPU and memory constraints
- **Scaling Policies**: Implemented scale-up and scale-down behaviors
- **Metrics Integration**: Connected HPA with Metrics Server

### 7. External Access & Security
- **NodePort Services**: Enabled external access with auto-assigned ports
- **Security Groups**: Configured AWS security groups for port access
- **Health Checks**: Implemented liveness and readiness probes
- **Resource Quotas**: Applied resource limits and requests

### 8. Testing & Validation
- **Deployment Testing**: Verified all services start correctly
- **Health Check Validation**: Confirmed application responsiveness
- **Metrics Verification**: Validated metrics collection and dashboard functionality
- **Load Testing**: Tested auto-scaling behavior under load

## Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrates a production-ready e-commerce application deployment on Kubernetes with comprehensive monitoring and auto-scaling capabilities. Key achievements include:

**Technical Success**: All components deployed successfully with proper service discovery, health checks, and external access. The monitoring stack provides real-time visibility into application performance, database metrics, and infrastructure health.
